# gh-combine-prs

This is an extension for [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) that combines multiple PRs into one.
It is intended for use in repositories that receive many PRs that can be merged simultaneously, e.g. trivial Dependabot version bump PRs.

The tool will attempt to create one PR that contains all PRs that:

* match a provided query - e.g. `--query "author:app/dependabot"` so that only Dependabot PRs are processed
* and have checks passing
* and that can be merged cleanly - e.g. if two combinable PRs conflict with one another, only one will be merged.

This tool does not automerge into the `master`/`main` branch - it just attempts to create one unified PR for review and automated checks to run against.

*Note: When you merge the combined PR, it is recommended that you create a Merge Commit.
This allows GitHub to automatically detect that all of the original combined PRs have been merged, so that their state can be set correctly.*
